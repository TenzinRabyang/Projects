Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard analyzing NHS A&E (Accident & Emergency) waiting times across 12 months (October 2024â€“September 2025). The dashboard visualizes key performance metrics, including the target performance, emergency admissions, breaches and decision-to-admit, using data sourced from NHS England. It demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills for healthcare analytics.

Development Process

Data Collection: Downloaded and organized 12 monthly A&E Excel files.
Data Preparation: Combined files using Power Query, cleaned metadata, and appended the data.
